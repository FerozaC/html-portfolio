However, it was in 2023 that I decided to take coding more seriously. This decision led me to ALX, where I delved into C
programming, shell navigation, and version control. This experience ignited my passion for coding and laid the
foundation for my journey towards becoming a Software Engineer.</p>

<h3>Current Focus</h3>
<p>Currently, I am immersing myself in the world of Web Development. I am enrolled in courses at The App Brewery through
Udemy and SheCodes, honing my skills in HTML and CSS alongside other web development technologies.</p>

<h3>Skills</h3>
<p>My current skill set includes proficiency in C programming, version control using GIT, and shell scripting. I am also
building a foundation in web development with a basic knowledge of HTML and CSS.</p>

<h3>Future Aspirations</h3>
<p>My ultimate goal is to contribute to the world of technology as a Software Engineer. I am excited about the endless
possibilities that coding brings and am dedicated to continuous learning and growth.</p>
